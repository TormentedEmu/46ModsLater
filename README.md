# 46ModsLater
A basic program that modifies a Unity game's assembly-csharp allowing more modification that what Harmony alone can accomplish.

Reboot of the popular SDX(Domonix) and DMT(Hal9000 [Link](https://github.com/HAL-NINE-THOUSAND/DMT)) programs.  Works with the latest stable release of Alpha version 21.

Allows the use of PatchScripts to enhance mod making with the use of the built-in Harmony system that is now in place with the latest game release.
